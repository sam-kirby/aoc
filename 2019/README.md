# Advent of Code 2019

Set of solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 challenges written in Rust.

## Running using Cargo
The simplest way to execute these solutions is through Cargo.

```sh
cargo run --release --bin dayX
```

Most days expect to find an input file of the form inputX.txt, however some take the input from the command line.
For example to run the solution for day 4 execute `cargo run --release --bin day4 <LOWER_BOUND> <UPPER_BOUND>`
